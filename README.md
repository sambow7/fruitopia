# 🫐 Fruitopia 🍓

# App Overview

This app is designed to display a list of fruits along with their details (name, color, and stock status). Users can add new fruits, mark fruits as "Out of Stock," and filter the list based on specific criteria, such as color or stock status.

## Features to Teach

- **Basic JSX**: Learn how to dynamically render fruit information from a JavaScript object or array.
- **Props**: Understand how to pass fruit data to components, such as `FruitCard` or `FruitList`.
- **State Management**: Use `useState` to manage the list of fruits and their availability status.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Display "Out of Stock" messages for unavailable fruits.
- **Lists**: Use `.map()` to render a list of fruits dynamically.
- **Events**: Handle user actions, such as adding a new fruit or toggling the stock status.
